Semester Project (2)
In short.
This is a semester project done by a group of students of AAU - CPH on our second semester.
We are developing an app to simulate a new system to nurses, that can prevent further wrongly medicated patients.
This application is made as an Android app Eclipse and Android Studio.

You must have a file called local.properties with the content ```sdk.dir=<sdk_dir>``` where <sdk_dir> is the path to your sdk root directory
